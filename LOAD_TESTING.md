# SomaSync Million Node Load Testing

This document explains how to run comprehensive load tests on SomaSync to validate its performance with massive node counts, up to 1,000,000 nodes.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ with Tokio async runtime
- At least 8GB RAM (16GB+ recommended for large tests)
- High file descriptor limits (`ulimit -n 65536`)
- Multiple CPU cores for parallel processing

### Running Load Tests

```bash
# Small test (1,000 nodes) - Good for development
cargo run --bin load_test -- --preset small

# Medium test (50,000 nodes) - Validate scalability
cargo run --bin load_test -- --preset medium  

# Large test (500,000 nodes) - Stress test
cargo run --bin load_test -- --preset large

# Million node test (1,000,000 nodes) - Ultimate challenge
cargo run --bin load_test -- --preset million
```

### Custom Configuration

```bash
# Custom node count and duration
cargo run --bin load_test -- --nodes 100000 --duration 600 --max-connections 20000

# Run via Make targets
make load-test-small
make load-test-medium  
make load-test-million
```

## Load Testing Strategy

### 1. Memory-Efficient Simulation

Instead of creating 1M actual SynapseNodes (which would require ~100GB+ RAM), we use:

- **Lightweight Node Simulation**: Virtual nodes that track state without full networking
- **Clustered Topology**: 1000 clusters of 1000 nodes each to simulate realistic network structure
- **Representative Testing**: Real SynapseNodes for a small subset to validate actual networking
- **Connection Pooling**: Semaphore-based connection limiting to prevent resource exhaustion

### 2. Realistic Network Topology

```
Million Node Network Structure:
├── 1,000 Clusters
│   ├── Each cluster: 1,000 nodes
│   ├── Intra-cluster: Full mesh (1000 × 999 connections)
│   └── Inter-cluster: Representative nodes connect clusters
└── Total: 1M nodes, ~999M intra-cluster + 999 inter-cluster connections
```

### 3. Test Phases

1. **Cluster Creation**: Batch creation of node clusters with progress tracking
2. **Inter-Cluster Connectivity**: Real network connections between cluster representatives  
3. **Message Propagation**: Threat intelligence message flow simulation
4. **Sustained Load**: High-frequency message generation under load
5. **Resource Monitoring**: Memory, connections, and error rate tracking

## Performance Expectations

### Hardware Requirements by Scale

| Scale | Nodes | RAM | CPU | Duration | Max Connections |
|-------|-------|-----|-----|----------|-----------------|
| Small | 1K | 1GB | 2 cores | 1 min | 500 |
| Medium | 50K | 4GB | 4 cores | 3 min | 5K |
| Large | 500K | 8GB | 8 cores | 10 min | 15K |
| Million | 1M | 16GB+ | 16+ cores | 20+ min | 25K+ |

### Expected Metrics

- **Node Creation Rate**: 10,000-50,000 nodes/second  
- **Message Throughput**: 100,000+ messages/second
- **Connection Success Rate**: >95% under normal load
- **Memory Efficiency**: ~1KB per simulated node
- **Error Rate**: <5% for sustainable loads

## Understanding the Results

### Key Metrics

```
LOAD TEST RESULTS
================================
Nodes Simulated: 1,000,000      # Total nodes simulated
Connections: 999,999,000      # Network connections established  
Messages Generated: 10,000,000     # Threat intelligence messages
Errors: 50,000                # Failed operations
✓ Success Rate: 95.00%          # Overall success rate
```

### What Each Phase Tests

1. **Cluster Creation** → Node instantiation scalability
2. **Inter-Cluster Connectivity** → Real network connection handling
3. **Message Propagation** → Threat intelligence routing efficiency  
4. **Sustained Load** → System stability under continuous load
5. **Resource Management** → Memory usage and connection pooling

## Interpreting Performance

### Success Criteria

- ✓ **Node Creation**: All 1M nodes created without memory exhaustion
- ✓ **Network Formation**: >90% of inter-cluster connections established
- ✓ **Message Flow**: >95% message delivery success rate
- ✓ **System Stability**: No crashes or resource exhaustion
- ✓ **Scalable Architecture**: Linear performance scaling with node count

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Memory exhaustion | OOM errors | Reduce batch size, increase RAM |
| Connection failures | Low success rate | Increase file descriptor limits |
| Slow performance | High latencies | More CPU cores, reduce concurrent connections |
| Network timeouts | Message delivery failures | Adjust timeout values, slower batch creation |

## Real-World Implications

### What This Tests For Cephalog

- **Tentacl Network Scalability**: Can the neural mesh handle enterprise-scale deployments?
- **Threat Intelligence Propagation**: How efficiently do security alerts spread across the network?
- **Resource Efficiency**: Memory and CPU usage for large-scale security monitoring
- **Network Resilience**: Fault tolerance under high load and partial failures

### Production Readiness Validation

This load test validates that SomaSync can handle:

- ✓ **Large Enterprise Networks**: 10,000+ endpoints with security agents
- ✓ **Threat Intelligence Sharing**: Real-time security data propagation
- ✓ **Geographic Distribution**: Multi-datacenter neural mesh networks
- ✓ **High Availability**: Graceful degradation under extreme load

## Advanced Testing

### Custom Scenarios

```rust
// Create custom threat intelligence scenarios
let config = LoadTestConfig {
    total_nodes: 100_000,
    test_duration_secs: 3600, // 1 hour sustained test
    messages_per_node: 100,   // High message volume
    // ... custom parameters
};
```

### Monitoring Integration

- Add Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring  
- Custom telemetry for specific use cases
- Integration with existing monitoring infrastructure

## Conclusion

The SomaSync million node load test provides comprehensive validation of neural mesh networking at enterprise scale. It demonstrates the system's ability to handle massive distributed networks while maintaining performance and reliability - critical for Cephalog's threat intelligence sharing capabilities.

For production deployments, start with smaller scales and gradually increase based on your infrastructure capacity and performance requirements.
