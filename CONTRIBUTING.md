# Contributing to SomaSync

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SomaSync! We welcome contributions from the community and are excited to see what you'll build.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ 
- Git
- A GitHub account

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/somasync.git
   cd somasync
   ```
3. Add the upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/dendritic-labs/somasync.git
   ```
4. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicating work
2. For large changes, please open an issue first to discuss the approach
3. Ensure your Rust toolchain is up to date: `rustup update`

### Making Changes

1. **Write Tests**: All new features and bug fixes should include tests
2. **Follow Rust Conventions**: Use `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`
3. **Document Your Code**: Add documentation for public APIs
4. **Keep Commits Focused**: Each commit should represent a single logical change

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with all features
cargo test --all-features

# Run clippy for linting
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check documentation
cargo doc --no-deps --document-private-items
```

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Run benchmarks (if available)
cargo bench

# Profile memory usage
cargo test --release -- --nocapture
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Tests pass locally (`cargo test`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`cargo fmt`)
- [ ] No clippy warnings (`cargo clippy`)
- [ ] Documentation builds (`cargo doc`)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and descriptive

### PR Requirements

1. **Clear Description**: Explain what your PR does and why
2. **Link Issues**: Reference any related issues with "Fixes #123"
3. **Tests Included**: New features need tests
4. **Documentation**: Update docs for API changes
5. **Small Scope**: Keep PRs focused and reviewable

### PR Template

When creating a PR, please include:

```markdown

## Issue Guidelines

### Bug Reports

Use the bug report template and include:
- Rust version (`rustc --version`)
- SomaSync version
- Operating system
- Minimal reproduction case
- Expected vs actual behavior

### Feature Requests

- Describe the problem you're trying to solve
- Explain why this feature would be valuable
- Consider backwards compatibility
- Suggest an implementation approach if possible

## Code Style

### Rust Conventions

- Follow standard Rust naming conventions
- Use `cargo fmt` with default settings
- Prefer explicit over implicit when it improves clarity
- Write self-documenting code with good variable names

### Documentation

- All public APIs must have documentation
- Include examples in doc comments when helpful
- Use proper markdown formatting
- Document error conditions and panics

### Testing

- Unit tests for individual functions/methods
- Integration tests for public APIs
- Property-based tests for complex algorithms
- Benchmark tests for performance-critical code

## ðŸš¦ Commit Guidelines

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
